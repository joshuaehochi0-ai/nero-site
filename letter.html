  <p>Happy Girlfriend's Day, Mama <br>

You're the best girlfriend I could ever ask for.
You're always the light of my day no matter how gloomy I feel or how bad my day has been, you always find a way to make me happy. You give me something to look forward to, day by day.

You're the first and only girl who truly understands me, always returning the same energy I give no matter how weird I may act. You're the one person I'm completely comfortable with, the one I can fully open up to.

Praise Oge-Nero, the love of my life, my number one motivation to become a better person. I truly believe we are soulmates. We’re meant for each other no matter what anyone else says. We'll prove them wrong. What we have is real love, and I know we can build something lasting and beautiful with it.

I know I don’t say this enough, but babe I love you.
I love everything about you: your smile, your eyes (I always get lost in them), your personality, your body. I'm madly in love with you.
And I want you to know that I will never, ever leave your side until death do us part.
